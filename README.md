# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System-AirSync-
#Abstract
This project implements a smart air quality monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller with DHT11 sensors to measure temperature and humidity. The system features a Flask-based web interface that displays real-time environmental data and enables Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates. Key components include a SQLite database for data logging, a responsive web dashboard with alert thresholds, and secure device authentication. The solution provides remote monitoring through a web interface with interactive data visualization, while the OTA update functionality allows for seamless firmware deployment without physical access to devices. The system demonstrates effective integration of IoT hardware with web technologies, implementing security features like password authentication and encrypted sessions. Designed for both home and industrial environments, AirSync offers reliable environmental monitoring with maintenance-free operation through its self-updating capability, representing a complete IoT solution from sensor to user interface.
